# Vestiaire-collective-bot
Hi, this program written in python takes and reorders your sales data on Vestiaire Collective in a csv sheet. Useful for those who want to monitor or analyze their career as a seller on the French site.  

## Libraries

Here you can see the various libraries I have used: 
- Bs4 (BeautifulSoup) 
- ConfigParser
- Selenium 
- Datetime 
- Shutil
- sys
- Csv 
- Os  

## Instructions to get started

To make the program work properly you need to download the Webdriver. The drivers for most browsers can be found here:
- [Chomedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
- [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver)

After you have downloaded your Webdriver, start the program and follow the instructions. For any problem write me.  Also you will need to install python on your pc. The version must be 3.7 or higher. You can find all the information here -> https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/  For now the program can only work on Windows. However, in the future I will add the ability to make it work on MacOs as well.
